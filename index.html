            <p>I live here, I love my country and my state. Venezuela is a beautifull country and has many things and biodiversity, it is interesting to know that Venezuela doesn't have four seasons like other countries, so I am not familiar with anything about the four station. Maybe the economic situation is not the best, but I love my country. Otherside, I love my state too, I grew up and studied here; I live in "Maturín" the capital of the state, it has the second largest cathedral in Latin America, and beautiful landscapes.</p>
